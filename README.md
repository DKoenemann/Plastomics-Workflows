# Plastomics-Workflows
Workflows for taking Illumina NGS data, assembling whole chloroplast genomes, annotating those genomes, reconstructing a phylogeny using those genomes, and calculating nucleotide diversity (Pi)

Three zipped folders are included, indicating the three major sections of the workflow.

"PlastomeAssembly.zip" - For assembling a chloroplast genome using PacBio or Illumina NGS reads. Contains a narrative of the workflow, including Linux commands for assembling a chloroplast genone using a reference, as well as R scripts for assessing the quality of the assembly.

"PlastomeAnnotation.zip" - For annotating assembled plastomes. Contains a narrative of the workflow, including Linux commands for comparing the annotated plastomes, as well as R scripts for comparing the annotated plastomes.

"PhylogeneticReconstruction.zip" - For using whole plastome assemblies to reconstruct a and fossil calibrate a phylogeny. Contains a narrative of the workflow, including Linux commands for reconstructing phylogenies, as well as example in-files for various phylogenetic programs.
